# Simulations---CWEN-model
The repository contains the deterministic Excel model and Python code to conduct simulations on that Excel sheet.

Here is a step-by-step guide to see how simulations were conducted for the purposes of the document titled - Monte Carlo Simulations for Scenario Analysis in Financial Modeling.

Step 1: Download the Excel and Python files in the same directory. (Excel File: Optimal; Python File: Excel & Python)

Step 2: Function change_inputs() (Line 57) contains all the distribution assumptions used for our simulations; you can change it according to your thesis.

Step 3: Line 84 contains the number of simulations that you would like to conduct. For our purposes, I have used 10,000 simulations, however it takes about 40 minutes to generate an output distribution. 

Step 4: Run code.
